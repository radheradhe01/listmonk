## Custom Modifications (Crown Solutions Fork)

### Email Tracking Configuration

For email tracking (opens, clicks) to work correctly, the `app.root_url` setting must point to a publicly accessible URL.

**Update via database:**
```bash
docker exec -it dev-db-1 psql -U listmonk-dev -d listmonk-dev -c \
  "UPDATE settings SET value = '\"http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:9000\"' WHERE key = 'app.root_url';"

# Restart backend
docker compose restart backend
```

**Or via Admin UI:** Settings → General → Root URL

### Gmail SMTP (Port 465) Fix

This fork includes a fix for Gmail SMTP on port 465 (direct TLS). The standard Listmonk only supports port 587 (STARTTLS).

**Changes made:**
- `internal/messenger/email/email.go` - Added support for direct TLS connections on port 465
- `models/campaigns.go` - Auto-inject tracking pixel for visual editor campaigns

### Visual Campaign Tracking

Visual editor campaigns now automatically include the tracking pixel (`{{ TrackView . }}`). No manual template modification required.
